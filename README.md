# A simple web app for object recognition with Tensorflow model

This repository represents my project for the Computer Systems Architecture course in my third year of college. I've developed a straightforward web application utilizing a Tensorflow model for object recognition. The application has the potential to evolve into a practical surveillance system, capable of alerting users upon detecting individuals entering the monitored area.
